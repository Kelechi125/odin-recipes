        <p>This is a quick and easy recipe for cooking grilled cheese sandwiches.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Two slices of cheese of one's choice</li>
            <li>Two slices of bread</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat a pan on the stove.</li>
            <li>Take one slice of bread and spread butter on one side. Repeat for the other slice.</li>
            <li>Take one slice of bread and lay the side with butter down inside the pan.</li>
            <li>Take the two slices of cheese and lay them on top of the slice of bread in the pan.</li>
            <li>Place the second slice of bread on top of everything in the pan with the buttered side facing up. Take a spatula and press down on the sandwich.</li>
            <li>Let the sandwich cook for some moments while checking to see if the bottom slice of bread is turning brown.</li>
            <li>When the bottom slice is brown enough to one's liking, take the spatula and flip the sandwich over so that the other slice of bread is on the bottom. Press down on the sandwich slightly again with the spatula.</li>
            <li>Let the sandwich cook again for awhile while monitoring the bottom slice.</li>
            <li>When the sandwich is deemed ready, turn off the stove. The sandwich is ready to be served!</li>
